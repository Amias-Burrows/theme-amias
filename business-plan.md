# Business plan for ***AR Burrows Creative Web Specialist***

## Business Idea

My business aims to help people understand the online world better by offering a service where people can booka slot to talk to me about *issues they are having with their online business* or just to see if there is *anything they can do to improve it*.  I have noticed many individuals not know how to start to get their business online so I am stepping in to be that bridge between the two.  I want to be able to advise my clients on where they should focus their efforts to find their customers and help them make their mark on the web.  Using my network I aim to help people find the businesses they need to improve their notoriety.

My idea is unique because I haven't been able to find anyone else who is offering the same services.  There are some, such as Ian Genius Who offers free 121 chats to help people improve their selling game.  This is what inspired me to do what I am starting to do.

My customers will want to use my services and follow through with a purchase because they will see I am friendly and feel more comfortable coming to me hoping to use my payed servies.  My free 121 chats and free-to-use knowledge will help people trust me and feel like they know me like a friend.

## Business Name

The business name is *AR Burrows Creative Web Specialist*.

This went through a few stages of development, starting out with *AR Burrows Freelance Web Developer*.  But I needed something more broad whilst still being specific enough to make sense.  I wanted to find something that told people that I am someone who is trustworthy to ask questions to because that is what I want to develop.

## Target Market & Demographic

My tarket market is small business owners.  Anyone from a tech-phobe all the way to tech-savvy individuals because everyone can benefit from what my business offers.  There are no gender barriers or age barriers because there are no physical or mental requirements for starting a business.  I don't want to close my doors to anyone who could be in need, and especially the people who don't know they're in need.

## Marketing

I will be posting blog posts on my website and sharing them to my social medias based upon what people in my target market may be struggline with.  As I talk to more potential customers I will be able to see where they are struggling with.  I will also make sure to find as many networking events as I can attend because this is where I will find the majority of my audience.  The word of mouth from past and potential customers will hopefully kick-start some positive results.

## Pricing

I will price my payed services quite low because small businesses don't like to impulsively spend big chunks of money.  If what they're looking at seems affordable and worth their time they will consider it so I want to keep my prices etween the £50 to £100 mark to put peoples mind at ease.

## Profit

My business doesn't have many overheads or subscriptions so most of the profit will be put into savings to prepare for big payments.  The rest will be my income which will cover my living costs and some left over for me to enjoy.
